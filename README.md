dart json hydrator

This is a tool for turning objects into JSON and back again.

It is based on code from Chris Buckett's JsonObject package, which you can find at
https://github.com/chrisbu/dartwatch-JsonObject

I created it because I wanted a way to hydrate objects from JSON without
relying on noSuchMethod.

It's probably not a speed demon.  It's a work in progress.  IF anyone wants
to contribute, they'd be my pal.

See the test case for an example of how to use it.
